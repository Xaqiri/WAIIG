# Writing an Interpreter in Go 

--- 

This will contain the code for the interpreters as I work through *Writing an Interpreter in Go*. In addition to **Go**, I plan on working through the book in a variety of other languages as well, as a way to compare and contrast the languages that I'm interested in and as an exercise to learn new programming languages.
