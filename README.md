# Writing an Interpreter in Go 

--- 

This will contain the code for the interpreters as I work through 
*Writing an Interpreter in Go*. In addition to **Go**, I plan on working 
through the book in a variety of other languages as well, as a way to compare 
and contrast the languages that I'm interested in and as an exercise to actually 
learn new programming languages. 

Currently planning on implementing the interpreter in these languages:  
**Go**  
**Python**  
**Rust** 
**Elixir**  
**Ocaml**  
**Odin**  
**Haskell**  

Of these I know **Go** and **Python**, so I'm looking forward to learning 
the other languages (*especially the functional ones*) with something as 
interesting as implementing an interpreter (*and eventually a compileer*)
